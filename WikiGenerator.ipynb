Why get vaccinated?\\nCOVID-19 vaccine can prevent COVID-19 disease. \\nVaccination can help reduce the severity of COVID-19 disease if you get sick.\\nCOVID-19 is caused by a coronavirus called SARS-CoV-2 \\nthat spreads easily from person to person. COVID-19 can be mild to moderate, lasting only a few days, or it can be severe, requiring hospitalization, intensive care, or a ventilator to help with breathing. COVID-19 can also result in death.\\nCOVID-19 symptoms may appear 2 to 14 days after \\nexposure to the virus. A person can have mild, moderate, or severe symptoms.\\n \\x82Symptoms can include fever; chills; cough; shortness of breath or difficulty breathing; fatigue (tiredness); muscle or body aches; headache; new loss of taste or smell; sore throat; congestion or runny nose; nausea; vomiting;  and diarrhea.\\n \\x82More serious symptoms can include trouble breathing; persistent pain or pressure in the chest; new confusion; inability to wake or stay awake; and pale, gray, or blue-colored skin, lips, or nail beds (depending on skin tone).\\nOlder adults and people of any age with certain underlying medical conditions (like heart or lung disease or diabetes) are more likely to get very sick with COVID-19.\\nAfter COVID-19 illness, some people get Long COVID, \\na chronic condition with symptoms lasting 3 months or longer. Symptoms of Long COVID may get better, get worse, or stay the same.\\nPeople who are up to date with COVID-19 vaccination \\nhave a lower risk of severe illness, hospitalization, and death from COVID-19 than people who are not up to  date. COVID-19 vaccination is the best way to prevent Long COVID.\\nGetting a COVID-19 vaccine helps the body learn how  \\nto defend itself from the disease and reduces the risk  for severe illness and complications. Additionally, COVID-19 vaccines can offer added protection to people who have already had COVID-19, including protection against being hospitalized if they become infected with COVID-19 again.2. COVID-19 vaccine\\nUpdated 2024–2025 COVID-19 vaccine is recommended \\nfor everyone 6 months of age and older. This includes \\nwomen who are pregnant, breastfeeding, trying to get \\npregnant now, or who might become pregnant in the \\nfuture.\\n2024–2025 COVID-19 vaccines for infants and children 6 \\nmonths through 11 years of age are available under \\nEmergency Use Authorization from the U\\n. S. Food and \\nDrug Administration (FDA). Please refer to the Fact \\nSheets for Recipients and Caregivers for more \\ninformation.\\nFor people 12 years of age and older, 2024–2025 \\nCOVID-19 vaccines, manufactured by ModernaTX, Inc. \\nor Pfizer, Inc., are approved by FDA.\\nNovavax COVID-19 Vaccine Adjuvanted (2024–2025 \\nFormula) vaccine is available under Emergency Use \\nAuthorization from FDA for people 12 years and older. \\nPlease refer to the Fact Sheet for Recipients and \\nCaregivers for more information.\\n\\x82 Everyone 6 months of age and older is recommended \\nto receive an age-appropriate FDA-approved or authorized \\nupdated 2024–2025 COVID-19 vaccine.\\n \\x82Certain people, such as those who have medical \\nconditions or are taking medications that affect \\nthe immune system, may need additional doses of COVID-19 vaccine. Y our health care provider can  advise you.\\nOFFICE  \\nUSE \\nONLY10/17/2024Vaccine Information Statement\\nCOVID-19 Vaccine3. T alk with your health care provider\\nTell your vaccination provider if the person getting  \\nthe vaccine:\\n \\x82Has had an allergic reaction after a previous dose of COVID-19 vaccine or has any severe, life-threatening allergies \\n \\x82Has had myocarditis  (inflammation of the heart muscle) \\nor pericarditis  (inflammation of the lining outside of the \\nheart)\\n \\x82Has had multisystem inflammatory syndrome (called MIS-C in children and MIS-A in adults) \\nIn some cases, your health care provider may decide to postpone COVID-19 vaccination until a future visit.\\nPeople with minor illnesses, such as a cold, may be \\nvaccinated. People who are moderately or severely ill, including with COVID-19, should usually wait until they recover.\\nCOVID-19 vaccine may be given at the same time as \\nother vaccines.\\n4. Risks of a vaccine reaction\\n \\x82Pain, swelling, and redness where the shot is given, fever, \\ntiredness (fatigue), headache, chills, muscle pain, joint pain, nausea, vomiting, and swollen lymph nodes can happen after COVID-19 vaccination.\\n \\x82Myocarditis (inflammation of the heart muscle) and pericarditis (inflammation of the lining outside the heart) have been seen rarely after COVID-19 vaccination. These risks have been observed most frequently in adolescent and young adult males. The chance of this occurring is low.\\nPeople sometimes faint after medical procedures, including vaccination. Tell your provider if you feel dizzy or have vision changes or ringing in the ears.\\nAs with any medicine, there is a very remote chance of a \\nvaccine causing a severe allergic reaction, other serious injury, or death.\\nV-Safe is a safety monitoring system that lets you shar e\\nwith CDC how you, or your dependent, feel after getting\\nCOVID-19 vaccine. Y ou can find information and enrollin V-Safe at vsafe.cdc.gov.5. What if there is a serious problem?\\nAn allergic reaction could occur after the vaccinated person leaves the clinic. If you see signs of a severe allergic reaction (hives, swelling of the face and throat, difficulty breathing, a fast heartbeat, dizziness, or weakness), call 9-1-1 and get the person to the nearest hospital.\\nSeek medical attention right away if the vaccinated person \\nexperiences chest pain, shortness of breath, or feelings of having a fast-beating, fluttering, or pounding heart after COVID-19 vaccination. These could be symptoms of myocarditis or pericarditis.\\nFor other signs that concern you, call your health \\ncare provider.Adverse reactions should be reported to the Vaccine \\nAdverse Event Reporting System (V AERS). Y our health care provider will usually file this report, or you can do it yourself. Visit the V AERS website at www.vaers.hhs.gov or call 1-800-822-7967. VAERS is only for reporting reactions, and VAERS staff do not give medical advice.\\n6. Countermeasures Injury\\nCompensation Program\\nThe Countermeasures Injury Compensation Program (CICP) is a federal program that may help pay for costs  of medical care and other specific expenses of certain people who have been seriously injured by certain medicines or vaccines, including this vaccine. Generally, \\na claim must be submitted to the CICP within one (1)  year from the date of receiving the vaccine.

for Longer -Term  Impacts  of COVID -19 Executive S ummary \\nOn April 5, 2022, President Biden issued the Memorandum on Addressing the Long -Term \\nEffects of COVID-\\u206019 outlining actions neede d to support the American people  in addressing the \\nlong er-term effects of COVID- 19. The President charged the Secretary of Healt h and Human \\nServices with coordinating a U.S. government -wide response to Long COVID. An element of that \\nresponse  was for the Department of Health and Human Services, in collaboration with federal \\npartners,  to develo p two reports: the Services and Supports for Longer -Term Impacts of COVID -\\n19 Report (Services Report  and the Nation al Research Action Plan on Long COVID (Research \\nPlan. The Services Report outlines current  feder al services and mechanisms of support \\navailable to the American public i n addressin g the longer -term effects of COVID -19, including \\nLong COVID and related conditions,  medical health and substa nce use challenges,  and \\nbereavement. The Research Plan provides the first U.S. government-w ide national research \\nagenda focused on advancing preve ntion, diagnosis, treatment,  and provision of services and \\nsupports for individuals and families experiencing Long COVID.  \\nLonger -term effects of COVID -19 including Long COVID \\nCOVID -19 has affected all aspects of health,  including ment al health , and disrupted daily life. It \\ncreated additional obstacles for those experiencing mental health and substance use \\nchallenges. Further,  many people  have been force d to cope with the deat h of love d ones , \\nespecially c hildren, and face the aftermat h of those losses. Millions of Amercians continue to \\nexperience lingering symptoms after an initial infection with SARS- CoV-2, the virus that causes \\nCOVID -19. This r epor t outlines federally funded supports and services for individuals \\nexperiencing the effects of COVID -19 in the areas of ment al health, substance use, and \\nbereavement. I n addition,  the Services Report lists federal ly funde d supports and services for \\nindividuals experiencing disabilities due to Long COVI D and associated conditions.  \\nLong COVID \\nIn April 2020, shortly after t he beginning of the pandemic,  anecdotal reports from patients \\nstarted to emerge that previously healthy individuals were experiencing lingering symptoms \\nand were  not fully r ecovering from infection with SARS- CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID- 19. \\nRecovery f rom infection can vary f rom person to person,  most individuals seem to recover \\nquickly a nd completely; however,  some  individuals report symptoms that persist or emerge \\nweeks or even months after the acut e phase of the infectio n has passed,  even whe n the \\ninfection was asym ptomatic . These  sets of conditions are often referred to as “Long COVID.” \\nLong COVI D is a term created and promulgate d by patients,  and recognizes the importance of \\ntwo technic al terms,  Post -COVID -19 conditions,  or PCC, broadly equivalen t to Long COVID,  and \\nPost -acute  Sequalae of SARS- CoV-2 infection,  focuse d on the direct effects of the virus. \\n6 \\nServices  and Supports  for Longer -Term  Impacts  of COVID -19 •Individuals e xperiencing Long COVID and associated conditions\\n•Health care personnel wh o work with a nd treat individuals e xperiencing Long COVID\\n•Individuals\\n experiencing longer-te rm impacts of COVID-19 , including ment al health and\\nsubstance  use challenges\\n•Individuals dealing w\\nith the loss of family members or loved ones to COVID -19.\\nThe report s erves a s an initial resource g uide t o help i ndividuals, their families,  and caregivers \\nfind needed supports,  services,  and re asonable  modifications  to receive health c are a nd \\ntreatment,  work,  go to s chool, a nd stably l ive in the c ommunity.

Eleven \\ndays later, the Department of Health and Human Services declared a public health emergency. \\nOn March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 outbreak a \\npandemic in light of the alarming spread and severity of the disease across the world. Now, two \\nyears later, not only has the United States experienced over 86 million confirmed COVID-19 \\ncases and a staggering one million deaths from COVID-19, but also these numbers continue to \\nrise. The pandemic has disproportionately impacted communities of color and other \\nunderserved groups, especially those with disabilities and older adults, exacerbating the \\nexisting health inequities in our country and highlighting social and racial injustices that impede \\nequitable health outcomes. \\nWe have lost neighbors, parents, spouses, children, friends, and colleagues because of the \\npandemic, and millions continue to grieve the loss of loved ones.  \\nBeyond the human toll, COVID-19 changed the way we live. It contributed to job losses, \\nbusiness closures, children staying home from school, food insecurity, and housing instability. \\nEfforts to reduce the spread of the disease have contributed to social isolation, loneliness, and \\ndetriments to mental and emotional health.  \\nToday, we continue to make advancements in addressing this pandemic by improving vaccine \\navailability, increasing access to testing, expanding treatment for COVID-19, and enhancing \\nresearch to advance our understanding of the epidemiology and impact of the disease. The \\nAmerican Rescue Plan has led to a remarkable and historically equitable economic recovery. \\nAlthough much work remains, we are thankfully moving towards a future in which we have \\nadditional tools to prevent, treat, and mitigate the risks associated with COVID-19.  \\nDespite these gains, emerging evidence suggests that, for many people, COVID-19 can have \\nlong-lasting health implications, commonly known as “Long COVID.” Long COVID refers to the \\nconstellation of symptoms that can linger or arise anew long after the acute phase of SARS-\\nCoV-2 infection. For persons affected by Long COVID, symptoms like fati gue,\\n shortness of \\nbreath, heart palpitations, and joint pain can persist long after the acute infection. Individuals \\nwith Long COVID can have symptoms that persist or emerge four weeks or longer after \\ncontracting COVID-19, and our understanding of the longer-term persistent symptoms remains \\nuncertain. Long COVID can hinder an individual’s ability to work, attend school, participate in \\ncommunity life, and engage in normal everyday activities. Further, the pandemic has increased \\nServices  and Supports  for Longer -Term  Impacts  of COVID -19 \\n9 \\nServices  and Supports  for Longer -Term  Impacts  of COVID -19 the burden of mental health and substance use  challenges, both directly and indirectly related \\nto COVID -19. Although our nation continues to make advancements in addressing this \\npandemic , a new  emphasis is necessary to address the impact of Long COVID and associated \\nconditions.  \\nFurther, we recognize the extensive leadership and work of state and local governments in \\ndelivering supports and services. It is only through continued collaboration that we can hope to mitigate the longer- term effects of COVID -19 and plan for future pandemics. In response to the \\nPresident’s directive to coordinate a federal response and provide individuals with the \\nresources they need, t his report outlines the services a nd mechanisms of support across \\nagencies that can assist people in America with addressing the longer -term impacts  of COVID -\\n19.Principles guiding this report include a commitment to health equity, patient and\\nstakeholder engagement, and public -private collaboration.\\nI want to  thank the staff in the 14 Departments  and agencies  who worked diligently to prepare \\nthis report. I also want to thank the Assistant Secretary for Health and the Assistant Secretary \\nfor Mental Health and Substance Abuse for their leadership in conceptualizing and driving the \\nproduction of this report. Finally, I want to express my sincere gratitude to numerous \\norganizations and individuals who contributed their time, resources, contacts, and invaluable conversations with us. This collab oration remains critically important in advancing the science \\nand paving the way for progress. Those with lived experiences are central to these efforts. \\n \\nSincerely,  \\nXavier Becerra  \\nSecretary of Health and Human Services  \\n10 \\nCOVID-19 has affected every U.S. community and so \\nmany aspects of our lives. \\nServices  and Supports  for Longer -Term  Impacts  of COVID -19 •There have been 86.6 million confirmed cases\\nof the illn ess, 4.8 milli\\non hospitalizations,  and\\nover one\\n million deaths f\\nrom COVID-1 93\\n•Over 200,000 children have lost a parent to\\nCOVID-1 9.4\\n•Almost 50 mi\\nllion people e ither did n ot work\\nor worked \\nfewer hours due to COVID-1 95\\n•In the first year of the pandemic ninety -three percent of children switched from\\nclassroom education to distance learning6\\n•In July 2020 t hirty million people reported their household d id not have enough to eat7\\n•In July 2020 f ifteen million people reported being behind in paying rent7\\n•In August 2020 s ixty- six percent of adults and 75 percent of young adults reported\\nfeeling socially isolated .8Chapter 1 : Introduction \\nCOVID -19 is a viral  disease caused by SARS- CoV-2, a coronavirus that emerged  in 2019. The \\nvirus spreads mainly from person to person through aerosolized respiratory droplets produced \\nwhen an infected person coughs, sneezes, or talks. Some people who are infected m ay not have \\nsymptoms. For others, symptoms may appear 2 to 14 days after exposure and can include fever, chills, and cough. Symptomatic and asymptomatic infected persons can be contagious. Adults 65 years and older and people of any age with underlying medical conditions are at higher risk for severe illness, but anyone can have severe illness from COVID -19. Not only has \\nthe pandemic affected individuals, but it has also had major economic and social impacts on communities and reduced the availability of resources for individuals who live and work in those communities. COVID -19 has caused major economic disru ptions, disconnected many \\nfrom community resources and support systems, and created widespread uncertainty and fear.  \\nThis in turn placed considerable stress on individuals and communities and may contribute to or exacerbate interpersonal or community viole nce.  The COVID -19 pandemic has placed \\nsignificant stresses on health systems, hospitals, primary care, practices and health care  \\npersonnel. It is only through extensive coordination and collaboration with state, tribal, and \\nlocal governments  that we can t ogether achieve our aims.  \\n21\\nCOVID -19 was the third \\nleading cause of death in \\n2020  and 2021  and second \\nleading cause of death in \\nJanuary 2022.1110 9\\n11 \\nServices and Supports for Longer-Term Impacts of COVID-19In 2020,  the u nemployment rat e reached it s highest peak s ince data c ollectio n began in 1948,\\nand almost 50 million p eople either did not w ork or wo rked f ewe r hours due to COVID -19.\\nAlthough t he unemployment r at e has s ince r eturned to r o ughly i ts pre-pandemic le vel, t he \\nlabor \\nforce participation rate  is lower tha n it was be fore the pandemic.   135 12\\nAt on\\ne time,\\n early i n the pand emic,  , 77 percent of public s chools a nd  73 p ercent of private \\nschools re por\\nted mo ving c lasses t o online d istance- learning f ormats .

Although this report focuses \\non service s for individuals, it is important to \\nnote  that,  because COVID -19 impacted family \\nmembers, caregivers, organizations, and communit ies, the federal response include s \\ncommunity -level programs and s ervices . \\nThese community -level programs and \\nservices, however , remain outside the scope \\nof this report.  \\nLong COVID  \\nAmidst the many challenges of the pandemic are the persistent health effects some individuals face well after their acute COVID -19 infection.  Recovery from infection with SARS -CoV-2, the \\nvirus that causes COVID -19, can vary from person to person. Most people seem to recover \\nquickly and completely. However, some report symptoms that persist or emerge weeks or even months after the  acute phase of  illness has \\npassed, sometimes even in asymptomatic cases. This condition is oft en referred to as “Long \\nCOVID.”   \\nAt this time, no laboratory test can definitively \\ndistinguish post- COVID conditions from other \\ncauses. A positive SARS- CoV-2 viral or antibody \\ntest result may help determine if there is a \\n15 Common Symptoms of \\n“Long COVID”51\\nServices and Supports for Longer-T erm Impacts of COVID-1 9 current or previous infection; however, these laboratory \\ntests are not required to establish a diagnosis of post-\\nCOVID conditions.   \\nThe medical, scientific, and public health communities \\nhave developed precise terms with agreed -upon, interim \\ndefinitions of Long COVID, such as Post -COVID -19 \\nconditions (PCC) and Post -acute Sequelae of SARS -CoV-2 \\ninfection (PASC), to use for communicating about clinical, \\nresearch, and public health activities (see Appendix C  in \\nthe Rese arch Report ). The first, Post -COVID -19 Conditions, \\nis equivalent to Long COVID and includes both direct and \\nindirect effects of the virus. It is useful in various clinical setting, assessing the burden to the health care  system, \\nand surveillance. The secon d, is Post -acute Sequalae of \\nSARS- CoV-2 infection, which aims to capture the direct \\neffects of the virus. It is used often in clinical contexts and critical to the medical research community aiming to understand the root causes of Long COVID. Additional research is needed to sufficiently separate the various \\nforms and conditions of Long COVID, including from pre -\\nexisting ones. The differences and nuances among the definitions reflect the central challenge of defining, \\nstudying, and addressing the impact of Long COVID. In \\naddition, some scientists and patient advocate \\ncommunities point to the importance of conditions associated with Long COVID, drawing parallels in symptoms and underlying biology to other diseases, such as post -infectious conditions. The term inology of Long \\nCOVID and associated conditions leverages existing experience and knowledge to recognize commonalities to better treat and care for the many affected individuals, including the domains of disability and insurance coverage. Although the defi nitions will likely change as we \\nlearn more, using terms with commonly understood definitions helps research and public health communities compare findings across studies and facilitates turning \\nsurveillance and research findings into action to improve \\npatient care.  \\nThroughout this report, it will be noted if and where \\nspecific research uses a more specific term (i.e., PCC, PASC). Also, it is emphasized that “Long COVID” is not just General symptoms  \\n•Tiredness or fatigue that interferes\\nwith daily life\\n•Symptoms that get worse afterphysical or mental effort (also\\nknown as “post -exertional malaise”)\\n•Fever\\nRespiratory and heart symptoms\\n•Difficulty breathing or shortness of\\nbreath\\n•Cough\\n•Chest pain\\n•Fast-beating or pounding heart\\n(also known as heart palpitations)\\nNeurological symptoms  \\n•Difficulty thinking or conce ntrating\\n(so\\nmetimes referred to as “brain\\nfog”)\\n•Headache\\n•Sleep problems\\n•Dizziness when you stand up(lightheadedness)\\n•Pins-and-needles feelings\\n•Change in smell or taste\\n•Depression or anxiety\\nDigestive symptoms\\n•Diarrhea\\n•Stomach pain\\nOther symptoms•Joint or muscle pain\\n•Rash\\n•Changes in menstrual cycles\\n16 \\nServices and Supports for Longer-T erm Impacts of COVID-1 9 one condition, and the use of the term Long COVID in this report should not be construed as \\nsuch.  \\nLong COVID can affect nearly every organ system and hinder an individual’s ability to work, \\nattend school, participate in community life, and engage in normal everyday activities. Long \\nCOVID can affect people r egardless of race, age, gender, or baseline health status. It is more \\ncommon in people with severe COVID- 19 who require  hospitalization or intensive care, \\nindividuals with underlying health conditions, unvaccinated individuals, and people affected by \\nhealt h disparities.  51\\nA ne\\nw CDC study reports that at least 30 days after having COVID- 19, one in five COVID -19 \\nsurvivors aged 18 –64 years and one in four survivors aged 65 years or older have a health \\ncondition that might be related to their previous COVID- 19 illness. People who had previous \\nCOVID illness had twice the risk for developing pulmonary embolism or respiratory conditions.52 \\nThe study looked at rates of 26 conditions known to occur after COVID- 19 (post -COVID \\nconditions). The report found that people that had past COVID -19, had twice the risk of \\ndeveloping a new condition compared with people without evidence of COVID- 19. The highest \\nrisks were for conditions involving the lungs, including blood clots in the lungs, and respiratory symptoms, although the conditions examined affected multiple body systems. The most common new conditions were respiratory symptoms and musculoskeletal pain.  \\n52\\nEsti\\nmates from the CDC study may not be generalizable to the broader U.S. population, but the \\nbreadth of symptoms and  conditions that are manifestations of Long COVID, and the potential \\nscale , are consistent throughout the scientific literature. Despite more precise estimates of risk, \\nit is evident that Long COVID already impacts a substantial number of people .  This num ber may \\ncontinue to grow, although vaccinations and prevention measures can help. The response to Long COVID will have to be at a scale and scope necessary to respond to the short -term and \\nlonger -term health care  needs of persons with this lived experience . \\nHuman -centered design and human- centered research, such as the HHS Health+ (“health plus”) \\ncycle for Long COVID, will be necessary to understand common experiences of individuals  living \\nwith Long COVID.  Health+ involves over 1,000 hours of interviews, workshops, listening \\nsessions, and human- centered research to co -create solutions with— not for —those impacted \\nby Long COVID . Through human- centered research Health+ will identify opportunity areas that \\nmatter most to patients and help to guide  federal action.53\\nBey\\nond the health complications it causes, Long COVID has resulted  in decrease d employment \\nand billions of dollars in lost income. As individuals experiencing Long COVID \\ndisproportionately work in the service sector, this has led to a la bor shortage in this industry, \\nwhich may contribute to inflation. Health care cost burdens are also expected to increase for \\nnew chronic conditions, such as heart disease, diabetes, and kidney disease, that may be attributable to COVID- 19.\\n5554 54 \\n17 \\nServices  and Supports  for Longer -Term  Impacts  of COVID -19 Individuals Who Experience \\nDisabilities from Long COVID  \\nFor some, whose Long COVID substantially limits their \\nmajor life activities, their illness may qualify as a disability  under disability rights laws . Whether Long \\nCOVID is a disability depends on how Long COVID \\naffects the individual . Other laws define disability \\ndifferently, and individuals will need to meet those definitions to qualify for those programs.  The following \\nexamples highlight cases where Long COVID may be a \\ndisability according to the Americans for Disabilities Act (ADA)  and other disability rights laws . \\n56\\n•A pe\\nrson with Long COVID who has lung damage\\nthat causes shortness of breath, fatigue, andrelated effects is substantially limited inrespiratory function, among other major life\\nactivities\\n•A person with Long COVID who has symptoms\\nof intestinal pain, vomiting, and nausea thathave lingered for months is substantially limitedin gastrointestinal function, among other majorlife activities\\n•A person with Long COVID who experiences\\nmemory lapses and cognitive impairment (or\\n“brain fog”) is substantially limited in brainfunction, concentrating, and thinking.\\nWhen Long COVID qualifies as a disability under federal \\ndisability rights laws, individuals are eligible for reasonable accommodations, such as\\n, 5756\\n•Modifying a policy to allow a person whoexperience dizziness when standing to be\\naccompanied by their service animal that is\\ntrained to stabilize them\\n•Providing an employee who  has fatigue issues  a\\nmodified work schedule\\nLong COVID and Disability  56\\n•According to official guidance\\nfrom the Office for Civil Rights of\\nthe Department of Health and\\nHuman Services , the Civil Rights\\nDivision of the Department of\\nJustice, and the Equal\\nEmployment OpportunityCommission, Long COVID can be a\\ndisability under the ADA, Section s\\n501 and  504 of the Rehabilitation\\nAct, and Section 1557 of the\\nAffordable Care Act if itsubstantially limits one or moremajor life activities\\n•These federal laws provide\\nprotection from discrimination for\\npeople with disabilities\\n•Major life activities include, but\\nare not limited to, carin g for\\noneself, performing manual tasks,seeing, hearing, eating, sleeping,\\nwalking, standing, sitting,reaching, lifting, bending,speaking, breathing, learning,\\nreading, concentrating, thinking,\\nwriting, communicating,interacting with others, andworking .

Children especially may have \\ntrouble describing their experiences with Long COVID. Extra accommodations, such as extra \\ntime on tests, scheduled rest periods throughout the day, or a modified class schedule may be \\nnecessary for children experiencing Long COVID.  This guidance also applies to colleges and \\nuniversities, although they are not required to identify students with disabilities. Rather, college \\nand university students may request accommodations.  \\n5958\\nA stu\\ndent may also qualify for special education based on the Individuals with Disability \\nEducation Act (IDEA) if the student has limited strength, vitality, or alertness due to a chronic or acute health problem that adversely affects the child’s educational perfo rmance, as determined \\nby a comprehensive evaluation. For example, children with development al delays due to severe \\ncases of Long COVID may qualify. IDEA requires states to have a system in place to identify and evaluate children with a disability and provide early intervention services as soon as possible.  \\nPurpose of the Report  \\nOn April 5, 2022, President Biden issued the \\nMemorandum on Addressing the Long -Term \\nEffects of COVID- \\u206019, charging  the Secretary of \\nHealth and Human Services (Secretary) with coordinating the federal response, in \\nengagement with public - and private -sector \\npartners , to the long er-term effects of COVID- 19. \\nAs part of the federal response, President Biden \\ndirected  the Se cretary, with input from federal \\nagencies , to produce two reports within 120 \\ndays. This first report, the Report on Services and \\nSupports for Longer- Term Impacts of COVID -19, \\noutlines the services and mechanisms of support across agencies that assist the American \\npublic in addressing the l onger -term effects of COVID -19, including mental health, substance \\nuse, bereavement, Long COVID and related conditions. The second report, titled the National \\nResearch Action Plan, provides the first government -wide national research agenda focused on \\nunderstanding and treating Long COVID.  \\n“Honestly, I don’t know where to refer \\npeople who have Long COVID symptoms. There are so many people suffering. E ven when there is a Long \\nCOVID expert in the area, there is a wait time of at least 4 months for an appointment.”  \\n—Community health worker  \\nServices  and Supports  for Longer -Term  Impacts  of COVID -19 The purpose of this repor t is to outline the current service s and s upport s acro ss federal \\nagencie s to addre ss the far-reaching and longer -term e ffect s of COVID- 19, including Long \\nCOVID and associated conditions,  mental health and substance use challenges, and \\nbereavement. This report highlights over 2 00 services and supports that are currently \\nsupported by the U.S. government. This report,  as well as the National Research Action Plan on \\nLong COVID,  are intended to serve as two tools in the larger ecosystem of the neede d \\nresponse  to the longer-t erm impacts of COVID-1 9. The federal government will c ontinue to \\ninvest in services and supports, and strive to improve how these programs can address the \\nspecific needs of the population as we continue to learn more. In development of this report \\nand through engagement with a broa d group of partners it is recognized that more will be \\nneeded. In addition,  it is recognized that some  individuals may need supports across multiple \\ndomans such as services for Long COVID and supports for bereavement.  Finally, many of the \\nresources listed are accessible to broader populations with disabilities. In addition, many \\nfederal agencies have resources that are specific to individuals with pre-e xisting medical \\nconditions,  such as individuals with HIV and AIDS. Those resources are beyond the scope of \\nthe report.  \\nThis report provides practical information and describes the federally funded services and \\nsupports available for  \\n•Individuals experiencing Long COVID and associated conditions\\n•Health care  personnel  who work with and treat individuals experiencing Long COVID\\n•Individuals experiencing longer- term impacts of COVID -19, including mental health and\\nsubstance use challenges\\n•Individuals dealing with losing a family member or loved one to COVID -19.\\nMethodology for Assembling this Report  \\nThis report is published by the Secretary of Health and Human Services, supported within  the \\nDepartment of Health and Human  Services by the Assistant Secretary for Health and the \\nAssistant Secretary for Mental Health and Substance Use. The content of the report was guided \\nby the recommendations issued last year by the Presidential COVID -19 He alth Equity Task \\nForce. The Department of Health and Human Services’ Office of Intergovernmental and \\nExternal Affairs hosted a series of interactive listening sessions from  April through June 2022 to \\nhelp develop th is report.

Under these \\nlaws, someone with Long COVID has a disability if the individual’s condition or any of its symptoms is a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities. There are additional rights discussed throughout this chapter.  \\nEach of these federal laws protects individuals  with \\ndisabilities from discrimination by “covered entities,” which are the employers and providers who must \\ncomply. Each law is slightly different in terms of rights \\nand obligations, but there is information about how these laws can help meet the needs of people with Long COVID in different topic areas , such as in workplaces, \\nschools, housing, or in accessing community services. In \\nsome top ic areas, such as education, there are additional \\nfederal laws that require services for someone with a disability.  \\n\\uf0d8The Department of Health and HumanServices (HHS) Office for Civil Rights (OCR)and the Department of Justice (DOJ) CivilRights Division ha ve issued Guidance on\\n“Long COVID” as a Disability Under the ADA,Section 504, and Section 1557\\n\\uf0d8The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission\\n(EEOC) addre sses Long COVID as a disability  and\\nthe employment rights of individuals with Long COVID.

Health care personnel worked \\nwith limited available knowledge or consensus on basic treatment protocols. We have since \\ngained more clinical knowledge about the prevention, diagnosis and management of acute \\nCOVID-19 infection, while evidence for Long COVID is just emerging. However, health care \\npersonnel are now coping with the still novel entity of Long COVID, and once again confronting \\nuncertainty and rapidly evolving evidence.  \\nCOVID-19 initially presented as acute pulmonary disease with high rates of mortality but \\nrapidly was recognized as a multisystem disease. The virus demonstrated its ability to attack a \\nwide range of organ systems, creating serious neurologic, cardiac, hematologic, renal, \\npulmonary, rheumatologic and other consequences that make support and treatment of \\nindividuals with COVID-19 exceptionally complex. Long COVID presents with an unusually \\nbroad set of symptoms and affects multiple organ systems, creating additiona\\nl challenges in \\nidentifying and treating patients.  \\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has placed significant stresses on health systems, hospitals and \\nindividual health care personnel. While hospitals are less crowded with people with COVID-19, \\nmany challenges remain in the ongoing function of health systems. These include increased \\ndemand due to delayed preventive and chronic care during the pandemic, supply chain delays \\nfor some medical equipment, and national shortages of staff, especially nurses. The resulting \\npressure to get by with fewer staff members leaves remaining health care personnel under \\ngreat stress, potentially resulting in further shortage and increasing the risk of providers \\nthemselves contracting COVID-19.  \\nIn addition to stress at work, many health care personnel face challenges at home due to the \\nimpact of COVID-19 on their family members, including both children and older people. The \\nmajority of health care personnel are women, many of whom shoulder considerable caregiving \\nresponsibilities.1 The psychological stress of providing health care during the pandemic is \\npowerful, with greater impact on those who are younger, people from racial and ethnic \\nminority groups, and those with minor children or an ill family member.2 In addition, health \\ncare personnel are now confronting the consequences of delayed preventive care and chronic\\nServices  and Supports  for Longer -Term  Impacts  of COVID -19 \\n77 •Resources  for healthcare  personnel  caring  for individuals  with Long  COVID\\n•Supports  for healthcare  personnel  who  are dealing  with  the stressors and traumas  of\\nserving on the front lines in the COVID- 19 response and the continued challenges of\\nworking in a system under stress.\\nResources for Health Care Personnel Caring for \\nIndividuals with Long COVID \\nResources for \\nHealthcare  Personnel  \\nThis section  includes  \\n•Federal Clinical Care\\nGuidance  for Long COVID\\n•Sample of Clinical CareGuidance  from  Professional\\nAssociations\\n•Federally SponsoredEducational  Programs  for\\nHealthcare Personnel\\n•Healthcare  Delivery  Systems\\nEquipped for Long COVIDCare\\n•Development of BestPractices  for Long  COVID\\nClinical Care.\\nServices  and Supports  for Longer -Term  Impacts  of COVID -19 This chapter presents U.S. government resources \\navailable to guide health care personnel in treating \\nindividuals with Long COVID.

There are several \\nexamples of ECHO or ECHO-like programs that have been adopted by federal agencies. \\nOne example is CDC’s Long COVID and Fatiguing Illness Recovery Program, which aims to \\nimprove the health of people who are medically underserved who have Long COVID and other \\ncomplex chronic conditions with similar symptoms, such as myalgic encepha lomye\\nlitis and \\nchronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) and other post-infectious fatiguing illnesses. This low-cost, \\nscalable model has potential to reduce he\\nalth inequities by increasing the capacity of healt\\nh \\ncare providers in underserved communities to deliver effective care informed by the latest \\nclinical advances. The program implements a randomized trial at the Family Health Centers \\nof \\nSan Diego, a large, Federally Qualified Health Center and a cohort comparison with patient\\ns at \\nthe University of Washington Long COVID Rehabilitation and Recovery Clinic. The program is \\nevaluating telementoring involving multi-specialty case\\n consultation and peer-to-peer sharing \\nof emerging promising clinical practices for managing Long COVID and improving provider- and \\npatient-level outcomes.

They \\nare at an increased risk for mental health challenges and are choosing to leave the health \\nworkforce early.4 They work in distressing environments that strain their physical, emotional, \\nand psychological well-being, making it harder for patients to get care when they need it. \\nCOVID-19 has created enormous stresses on both health care systems and their personnel. The \\nvast increase in seriously ill patients, the resulting lack of sufficient medical resources during \\nsurges, and the lack of established effective treatments, especially early in the pandemic, \\naffected health care personnel who also had ill family members and children forced out of their \\nordinary school routine. Current shortages of medications, other medical supplies, and staffing \\ncontribute to high ongoing stress levels in medical workplaces. These multiple factors created a \\ndevastating impact on health care personnel.

The COVID- 19 pandemic has \\naffected people’s mental health and created additional obstacles for those in need of \\nbehavioral health  care  to include mental health  and substance use care. A growing number of \\nadults in the United States reported mental health concerns since the start of the pandemic,2 \\nand many children and adolescents have experienced challenges to their emotional health and \\nwell- being., While already increasing before COVID -19, s ubstance use and drug overdoses \\nincreased in the United States after  the COVID -19 pandemic began, and we have learned that \\npeople with substance use challenges  and some mental illnesses are at increased risk for poor \\nCOVID -19 outcomes.  In addition, as the full impact of COVID- 19 unfolds, many Americans have \\nbeen forced to cope with the death of loved ones and face the aftermath of those losses.  5431,\\nReso\\nurces are available to help.

The President emphasized a strong \\ncommitment to ensuring that individuals, families, and communities affected by COVID-19 \\nand Long COVID have access to programs and resources to help support healing, health, and \\nwell-being.  \\nThe Services and Supports for Longer-Term Impacts of COVID-19 Report is an important \\ncomponent of the overall federal response. It provides resources that are relevant to \\nindividuals with Long COVID, health care personnel addressing the needs of those with Long \\nCOVID, and individuals and their families who are experiencing the longer-term effects of \\nCOVID-19. To address the longer-term effects of COVID-19, the report includes supports and \\nservices that can help address mental health and substance use challenges that have \\nescalated during the pandemic. The report also includes a section on resources for those \\nmourning the loss of their loved ones.  \\nThis report compiles federal services and \\nsupports into one document. It includes a \\ndescription of the resources as well as \\ninformation on how to access them. For each \\nof the resources, a website or phone number is \\nprovided.  “Peopl\\ne experiencing Long COVID  \\nsymptoms don’t  know  where  to go. \\nEven when there is a COVID -19 \\nspecialist nearby, the wait is 6 -12 \\nmonths for an initial visit.”  \\n—Person  with  Long COVID  \\nServices  and Supports  for Longer -Term  Impacts  of COVID -19 The Department of Health and Human Services \\nhosted a s eries o f interactive lis tening s essions \\nto inform the develop m e nt of this R epor t and i ts c ompanion r eport,  the National Res earch \\nAction P lan on L ong C OVID .

Many \\nacknowledged that a part of the population \\nremains skeptical about COVID-19 generally. \\nWith the combination of lack of information \\nand skepticism,  many people do not know \\nwhat is happening to them when they \\nexperience symptoms. They can feel alone, \\nfrightened,  and sometimes ashamed.  \\nSeveral suggested that establishing a central \\nlocation for information,  such a s a national  \\nwebsite,  would be a step in the  right \\ndirection. It would allow individuals \\nexperiencing Long COVID and other \\nproblems related to the  pandemic and \\nothers to have confidence in the source of \\ninformation.  \\nServices  and Supports  for Longer -Term  Impacts  of COVID -19 •Long C\\nOVID advocates\\n•Disability and chronic illness advocates\\n•Provider g\\nroups and organizations\\n(health care organizati ons  and\\nsystems, community health c enters,\\nmental health,\\n hospitals)\\n•Researchers,  including \\npatient\\nresearchers\\n•Public he alth partners\\n•Professional organizations\\n•Mental health advocates\\n•Children’s advocates\\n.\\n114 \\nMake Information, Services, and Supports Available to People with \\nAffected by the Pandemic —Parent  of a child  with  Long \\nCOVID  \\nMany individuals affected by the pandemic, including Long COVID, are not getting the services \\nthey require\\n and are at risk of losing their jobs, their homes, and their families. For example, \\nparticipants in the listening session voiced their experiences with community service providers \\nand their health care providers being reluctant to label their Long COVID symptoms as being a \\ndisability. They noted that many of the people who administer public support programs are not \\naware that Long COVID can cause  disabilities. \\nThey mistakenly assume they cannot help people \\nwith Long COVID by providing financial assistance and other supports. Further, several \\nindividuals reported that their employers were unwilling to make workplace\\n accommodations, \\nsuch as allowing them to telework from home, they had no recourse, and they lost their jobs. \\nClarify  that Long\\n COVID can be a Post- Infectious Condition\\nMany reported that health care providers were too quick to dismiss or ignore some of the \\nfeatures of Long COVID. Features of Long COVID overlap with many mental health conditions, \\nand health care providers need to be able to identify Long COVID to help people manage their \\nsymptoms. One person noted that current depression and anxiety disorder screening questions \\nServices  and Supports  for Longer -Term  Impacts  of COVID -19 Increase Attention on the Impact of the Pandemic on Children \\nParticipants in the listening sessions identified the lack of information,\\n research, and education \\nabout children with Long COVID as a high priority area to address. Many parents of children \\nwith Long COVID and other consequences of the pandemic talked about their frustration with \\nhaving their pedia\\ntricians and school administrators tell them that anxiety disorder, depression, \\nor puberty were to blame for their children’ s Long COVID symptoms. Many parents re\\nported \\nfeeling helpless when their children’s doctors wrongly indicated that Long COVID does not occur \\nin children.  Additional Services and Supports for \\nthose Experiencing Longer -term \\nImpact of the Pandemic Including \\nBerea vement  \\nParticipants in  the listening sessions acknowledged the \\nprofound impact of the death of a loved one and the \\nreality that some of us experienced numerous losses without time to process and grieve. The loss of a loved one \\ncan impact a sense of financial security, cause dep ression \\nand loneliness, and underscores the need to take \\nintentional action. Participants suggested expanded \\nmental health services, particulary school based services,  creation of a registry of providers who can support those \\nin need of grief counseling, to focus particularly on the communities hardest hit by the pandemic including the black \\nand American Indican/Alaskan Native communities.   “Parents seeking Long COVID care for  \\ntheir children do not have relevant \\ninformation  to challenge  pediatricians \\nor teachers who dismiss children’s symptoms as puberty, growing pains, or moodiness.”  \\n115 may falsely classify individuals with Long COVID as having a mental illness (or vice versa) and \\nmay miss the association with having had COVID-19. Another person related that emergency \\ndepartment staff informed her that rapid heartbeat, anxiety about her health, and \\nhopelessness were indications of an anxiety disorder rather than recognizing these as common \\nfeatures of Long COVID.  \\nEnsure that Services are Accessible, Culturally Informed and \\nLinguistically Effective  \\nMany of the individuals in the listening sessions emphasized that communications should be \\naccessible, clear, and provided in the language of the population served. People from racial and \\nethnic minority groups and the LGBTQI+ community discussed the barriers to receiving services \\nin their communities. They describe d the stigma\\n, racism, ableism, and provider bias within \\ntheir communities regarding COVID-19. They noted the lack of COVID-19 research with diverse \\npopulations and the lack of providers who work close by and are able and willing to work with \\nnon-English spea kers. People with disabil\\nities are experiencing barriers in receiving services, \\nincluding long wait times, and problems with access and safety. \\nReduce Long  Waits\\n for Services \\nA critical workforce shortage exists within the health care system. Not enough providers are \\navailable to serve the needs of the anticipated number of individuals experiencing Long COVID \\nsymptoms. People with Long COVID reported \\nwaiting 4 to 12 months for an initial \\nappointment with a medical specialist, such as a \\nneuropsychologist, cardiologists, or \\npulmonologist. An individual shared that very few medical care providers have multidisciplinary practices, so they were forced to visit four to five different provider’s offices when they were so tired they could hardl y walk. \\nListening session participants highly recommended telemedicine and clear guidance \\nabout how to access immediate care. Several \\npeople urged that states eliminate barriers to cross-state telehealth and expand cell phone \\ncoverage in rural areas.  \\nServices  and Supports  for Longer -Term  Impacts  of COVID -19 \\n“I got COVID -19 and I was embarrassed  \\nthat I continued to have symptoms  \\nafter the 14 day quarantine. I am 70 \\nyears  old. I doubted  my own symptoms \\nfor so long. I was afraid to even go to my doctor because I thought they wouldn’t believe me.”  \\n—Person  with  Long COVID  \\nProvide Clinical Guidance and Support  for Healthcare Personnel \\nHealth care personne l who participated in the l\\nistening sessions reported the need for guidance \\non how to address the multiple needs of patients with pandemic consequences. They reported \\ntreating individual symptoms without havi\\nng a clear understanding of how to address the \\noverall condition. Very few said that they worked within a Long COVID medical center, and so \\nthey felt overwhelmed by the number of people coming to see them since the pandemic \\n116 \\nServices  and Supports  for Longer -Term  Impacts  of COVID -19 started. They voiced the need for clinical \\nguidance on care coordination  and referrals \\nfor Long COVID patients. They identified \\nneeds for continuing education on topics such as common post -infectious conditions \\nand common Long COVID symptoms, and treatment.  \\nCOVID -19 has exacerbated existing shortages \\nin health  care personnel, and a critical \\nimperative remains to grow, support, retain, \\nand efficiently deploy the health care  \\nworkforce . In particular, it is important to \\nidentify  which factors (e .g., wages, \\nopportunity for career advancement, sched ule flexibility, engagement ) and which \\nsystem -level strategies (e.g. , education, \\nstaffing and safety policies, coaching)  can \\nimprove the job satisfaction, engagement , \\nand well -being of the health care workforce . \\nChallenges with Addressing the Longer -\\nTerm Impacts of COVID-19  \\nInfluenced by the public listening sessions, 14 U.S. government departments and agencies coordinated to draft this report. Departments identified current supports and \\nservices available  for those experiencing Long COVID and the longer -term effects of COVID- 19. \\nMany of the  resources existed before the pandemic and offer services and suppo rts to \\nindividuals and their family members who have disabilities. Depending on their level of disability and need, many individuals experiencing the longer- term effects of COVID -19 can \\naccess these programs to meet their needs.  \\nAs part of their work in compiling this report, federal departments also identified challenges to ensuring accessible resources to those in need. The five challenges most commonly reported by \\nfederal departments were lack of awareness; difficulties reaching individuals and families  due \\nto COVID -19 precautions; s tatutory limitations ; limited resources ; and i nsufficient data. The U.S. \\ngovernment will work to address each of these challenges. These challenges provide an opportunity for federal departments and agencies to improve services and supports.  \\nFederal Government Efforts That \\nWill Improve Identification of Long \\nCOVID and Connect Patients to Care  \\n•Convene pu blic and private partners to\\nbetter alig n the definitions of Long\\nCOVID  and develop agreed upon\\nterminology for clinical care,surveillance, and research\\n•Develop comprehensive and equitableLong COVID diagnosis, care, andtreatment guidance\\n•Make available tools to help individuals\\nrecognize symptoms of Long COVID and\\nto discuss their symptoms with theirhealth care providers\\n•Advance research that helps separatethe broader effects of the pandemic onan individual’s physical and mentalhealth from those of the initial SARS-CoV-2 infection and re -infections\\n•Use findings from Health+ Long COVID\\npatient -centered research to improve \\nthe way individuals access and r eceive \\nhealth care and services.  \\n117\\nServices  and Supports  for Longer -Term  Impacts  of COVID -19 Lack of Awareness \\nPublic awareness  of the full range of government service s and supports for individuals \\nexperiencing longer- term effects of the ongoing pandemic remains limited. I ndividuals \\nexperiencing the impacts of COVID- 19, their family members, health care providers, schools, \\nemployers, and state age ncies that administer f ederally -funded programs  may be unaware of \\nthe resources and services available through U.S. government programs. Many were also \\nunaware of changes to eligibility criteria for these programs that now allow for individuals with Long COVID to participate. Other times, individuals may know about a resource but not know how to access  it. Expanding awareness will require enhanced coordination and outreach to \\nensure consistency in various activities and programs.  \\nDifficulties Reaching Individuals and Families  \\nSome federal programs leverage  technology to create flexible ways of connecting with \\nindividuals. O ther programs have difficulty maintaining sufficient engagement with patients \\nthrough remote settings.  The problem has persisted and created a gap in services and supports, \\nespecially among those focused on recovery support services for substance use concerns.  \\nThe COVID -19 pandemic expanded how federal agencies use technology to engage with clients , \\nand efforts are underway  to determine how technology can be further and effectively \\nleveraged.  \\nInsufficient Data  \\nWe are only beginning to understand the exact nature of Long COVID . Insufficient data about \\nthe longer -term impacts of COVID -19 make it difficult to accurately inform federal programs \\nserving target popu lations. For example, some people have well -recognized longer -term \\nillnesses related to COVID -19, such as myocarditis, lung fibrosis, or diabetes . Management of \\nthese illnesses can follow  established medical approaches.  Others with Long COVID may \\nexperienc e non -specific symptoms , such as periodic fatigue, “brain fog ,” or anxiety , which can \\nbe more challenging to recognize and manage. Enhancing the capacity to capture and analyze \\ndata may accelerate learning about how to prevent, diagnose, and manage the longer -term \\neffects of COVID- 19. As the evidence accumulates, living evidence reviews, guidelines, and \\nclinical decision supports will need to be developed so that individuals and their families receive the full array of service s and supports that they need. With more knowledge  from persons \\naffected by Long COVID, based on their experiences of living with it, programs can offer \\nrelevant and needed services.  \\nLimited Resources \\nLimited resources, such as staffing or funding , limit the impact of programs . The most common \\ngap identified was created due to stagnant funding levels . Understanding and articulating the \\nimpact of these limited resources will support future requets to Congress for funding to address \\n118 \\nServices  and Supports  for Longer -Term  Impacts  of COVID -19 the longer -term impact of COVID -19, including Long COVID and associated conditions, mental \\nhealth and substance use challenges , and bereavement.   \\nThe National Research Action Plan on Long COVID  \\nThe companion document to this report, the  National Research Action Plan on Lon g COVID , will \\nbe essential in advancing progress in the provision of services and supports for individuals and \\nfamilies experiencing Long COVID .  \\nUnderstanding the need for and access to services and supports, including disability services \\nand caregiver su pports, is part of the National Research Action Plan. Research must identify \\nstrategies to address the pandemic’s disproportionate impact on certain communities and \\npopulations . We must identify ways to translate research into equitable service delivery. \\nQualitative and quantitative research methods are complementary for a more complete \\nunderstanding of the health and socioeconomic burdens on individual s affected by COVID- 19, \\nand among different races, ethnicity groups, pregnant people, and those with under lying \\ndisabilities.  \\nConclusion \\nAlthough we are still learning about Long COVID and the longer -term impacts of COVID -19, a lot \\nhas been done , and there are substantial services and supports through many U.S. government \\nprograms to support those affected. This report is the first iteration of a compendium of \\nsupports for use by individuals, communities, and health enterprises. In upcoming months  and \\nyears, the U.S. govern ment will continue to invest in supports and further refine the scope of \\nservices as we learn more through lived experiences and research about Long COVID and the \\nother longer -term impacts of COVID -19.  \\nMoving forward, federal de partments will continue to engage with partners, including state and \\nlocal governments. Engagement of nongovernmental experts, organizations, and stakeholders, \\nincluding individuals affected directly by the long er-term effects of COVID -19, has played an \\nessential role in shaping the government’s response to COVID -19 and Long COVID, including the \\ndevelopment of this Report and the National Research Action Plan.  \\n119 Appendix A: Report Abbreviations  \\nAAA \\nACA \\nADA

The data sources for \\nthe Snapshot are Medicare Fee- for-Service (FFS) claims data, Medicare Advantage (MA) encounter data, and Medicare \\nenrollment information. \\nMedicare COVID- 19 Cases and Hospitalizations\\nMedicare COVID -19 Case: A count of beneficiaries with a diagnosis of COVID -19 on a claim or encounter record for any\\nhealthcare setting (e.g., physician’s office, inpatient hospital, laboratory).\\nWe use the following International Classification of Diseases (ICD), Tenth Revision (ICD -10), diagnosis codes to identify COVID -\\n19 cases on claims and encounters: \\n•B97.29 (other coronavirus as the cause of diseases classified elsewhere) -before April 1, 2020\\n•U07.1 (2019 Novel Coronavirus, COVID -19) –from April 1, 2020 onward.  \\nWe find COVID- 19 cases using ICD -10 diagnosis codes on claims and encounters. The Centers for Disease Control and \\nPrevention (CDC) has issued COVID -19 ICD -10 coding guidance . Diagnosis code accuracy depends on: (1) how clinicians \\ndocument (e.g., omitting information or using synonyms or abbreviations to describe a patient’s condition) and (2) medical coder\\nexperience and training. As a result, we consider diagnosis information from claims and encounters less reliable than clinical information collected other ways (e.g., chart reviews). Since we don’t need this type of clinical information to run our prog rams, \\nwe only collect it in limited circumstances (e.g., for program integrity purposes).\\nMedicare COVID -19 Hospitalization : A count of beneficiaries with a diagnosis of COVID -19 on a claim or encounter record for an \\ninpatient hospital setting. These beneficiaries are a subset of the Medicare COVID -19 Cases described above.\\nFor snapshots with data received by March 19, 2021 and after, we use average monthly enrollment when calculating rates per 100,000 beneficiaries.  See the \\nmethodology document for more details. These changes will impact case and hospitalization \\nrates and must be considered when comparing rates to previously released snapshots. \\nPreliminary Medicare COVID -19 Data Snapshot\\nMedicare Claims and Encounter Data: January 1, 2020 to November 20, 2021, Received by December 17, 2021\\n2\\n2Medicare Enrollee Facts\\nAs of late 2021, around 64 million Americans are enrolled in Medicare: 56% in Medicare Fee-for -Service (FFS), also known as \\nOriginal Medicare, and 44% in Medicare Advantage (MA) plans. \\nRace/Ethnicity Data\\nA person’s race/ethnicity is identified using data collected by the Social Security Administration (SSA) with adjustments to imp rove \\nthe race/ethnicity classification for Hispanic and Asian/Pacific Islander populations. Specifically, CMS worked with the Researc h \\nTriangle Institute (RTI) to develop an algorithm that uses Census surname lists for likely Hispanic and Asian/Pacific Islander o rigin \\nand simple geography (residence in Puerto Rico or Hawaii) to improve the SSA race/ethnicity data. The variable developed using \\nthis algorithm is often referred to as the RTI Race Code. The race/ethnicity classifications are: American Indian/Alaska Nati ve,\\nWhite, Black/African American, Asian/Pacific Islander, Hispanic, and Other/Unknown.\\nNote: Even with the application of the RTI algorithm, comparisons to self -reported data show that race/ethnicity is still misclassified \\nfor some people (self -reported data is only available through survey and assessment data for a small subset of the Medicare \\npopulation). The RTI algorithm improves the accuracy of Medicare race/ethnicity data, but continues to undercount people with a \\nrace/ethnicity of Asian/Pacific Islander and American Indian/Alaska Native, and to a lesser extent Hispanic, in the Medicare \\npopulation.\\nMedicare Entitlement\\nMedicare entitlement is available to three basic groups of \"insured individuals\" –people age 65 and older ( aged) , younger people \\nwith disabilities ( disabled) , and people with end stage renal disease (ESRD). How a person qualifies for Medicare can change over \\ntime (e.g., when a person turns 65 his/her entitlement reason changes to aged). For purposes of this snapshot, people who have \\nESRD, regardless of whether they are also aged or disabled, are classified as ESRD .In all other cases, we use a person’s current \\nreason for entitlement ( aged or disabled).\\nFor additional details on data limitations, please see the disclaimer on the next page and view the methodology document avai lable \\nhere.\\nPreliminary Medicare COVID -19 Data Snapshot\\nMedicare Claims and Encounter Data: January 1, 2020 to November 20, 2021, Received by December 17, 2021\\n3\\n3What You Should Know When Using Our Data (Disclaimer)\\nYou should use caution when interpreting our data. We collect Medicare claims and encounter data for payment and other program p urposes, but \\nnot for public health surveillance. There will always be a delay or “claims lag” between when a service occurs and when the c laim or encounter for \\nthat service is in our database. The length of the lag depends on the service type and program. There may also be longer clai ms lag due to the \\npandemic, but we’re not sure of the impact. \\nHistorically, 90% of FFS claims across all claim types are submitted within 3 months, while 90% of MA encounters across all c laim types are \\nsubmitted within 12 months.
